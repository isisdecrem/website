	<h1>FOOP</h1>
	<p class="lead">Learn Scheme and Java based off Gunn's FOOP course. This course will teach you the basics of functional and object-oriented programming. If you plan on taking FOOP or APCS in high school this is a great way to prepare yourself. </p>

	<h1>SWIFT</h1>
	<p class="lead">Learn how to code your very own iPhone app. This course will teach you the basics of Swift, XCode, and Firebase data storage. Students will design apps that are a part of the curriculum and then at the end of the course design their own app based on their ideas. </p> 
    
    <h1>WEB DEV.</h1>
	<p class="lead">This course teaches you the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that you can get to building some websites! In the beginning of the course, we will familiarize your with HTML and CSS so that you can create basic but beautiful webpages. Next, we will get into the more difficult task of learning Javascript. Javascript is one of the most used langauges and will be used in creating a backend of your website. By the end of this course, you'll leave with a website more advanced than this one!</p>

				<h3> Learning </h3>
				<p> We believe in project based learning and student excitement. We do give lectures, but we reenforce the learning with projects each class. When possible we allow students to have a choice in the project we do to bring out their passion and teach them to love CS. </p>
