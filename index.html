				<h3> Learning </h3>
				<p> We believe in project based learning and student excitement. We do give lectures, but we reenforce the learning with projects each class. When possible we allow students to have a choice in the project we do to bring out their passion and teach them to love CS. </p>

				<h3> Students </h3>
				<p> Students should be middle school aged, but we have no requirements or restrictions. Students do not need any previous CS experience. We ask our students to bring computers they can work on and download the necessary software on. If a student does not have a computer we can try to provide one. </p>

	<p class="lead">Code.learn() is committed to making a difference. As a way of giving back, we have decided to donate all out profits. We are expanding on an initiative Isis began in 2018 to help improve public schooling in Tonga. Although Tongan public schools recieve US aid, they are still underfunded and lack adequate learning materials. The girls long-term goal is to help implement some sort of CS class in Tongan schools, but for now they are trying to raise money to send textbooks, notebooks, and pencils to Tonga this summer.  </p>
